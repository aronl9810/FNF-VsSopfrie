# FNF-testproject

This is a Friday Night Funkin project that I will be doing during my SEP freedom project. This project is one of the attempts I will be doing to get into the expo. I want to do something big so that it will be challenging and also fun to work on.

The engine used is Psych-Engine and was made by ShadowMario

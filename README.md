# FNF-VsSopfrie

This is a Friday Night Funkin project that I will be doing during my SEP freedom project. This project is one of the attempts I will be doing to get into the expo. I want to do something big so that it will be challenging and also fun to work on.

The character is based on a character I made way back. It is literally a ghost and that is it. I wanted it to keep it simple so what you are currently seeing is basically what I have as of right now but this shows that I can actually make something! 

The engine used is Psych-Engine and was made by ShadowMario
Thanks to all the people who helped me on making this reality. Although this is mostly a solo project, I recieved a lot of help which you know if you seen the EXPO.
